Uses two different Aimlabs APIs to calculate the rank distribution of the Voltaic community. 
As of right now I can only check the 8.7 million users that have a submitted gridshot score instead of the entire community.
Also I am requesting every scenario high score the player has instead of only the ones I need which is fairly slow.
